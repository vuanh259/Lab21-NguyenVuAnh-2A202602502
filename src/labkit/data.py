"""Chat templating, loss masking, and dataset prep.

The deck's claim (§17.2) is that loss masking and the chat template decide more
outcomes than every LoRA variant combined. This module exists so you can *see* the
mask rather than trust a library flag.

The masking technique used here renders the conversation to **text** around each
assistant turn, then maps character spans onto tokens:

    prefix = apply_chat_template(messages[:i], add_generation_prompt=True)   # text
    upto   = apply_chat_template(messages[:i+1])                             # text
    supervised characters = [len(prefix), len(upto))
    supervised tokens     = tokens whose offsets fall inside that range

**Why not just diff the token lists?** Because that is wrong on real templates, and
Qwen3.5 is the counter-example. Its prefix ends `<think>\n` while the full render
continues `\n</think>`; tokenized separately the trailing `\n` is its own token, but
tokenized together `\n\n` merges into a *different single token*. The token lists are
therefore not prefix-related even though the strings are. Diffing tokens raises a
false alarm at best and silently mis-masks at worst.

Characters do not have this problem, and `return_offsets_mapping` gives the mapping
back to tokens — including for special tokens like `<|im_end|>`, which must stay
supervised because it is the model's stop signal.
