"""Device and precision selection.

**Why this file exists.** The lab's default tier is a free-Colab **T4**, and a T4 is
Turing (compute capability 7.5). **Turing has no bfloat16 support** — bf16 needs
Ampere (8.0) or newer. Hardcoding `bf16=True`, which every 2026 tutorial does because
every 2026 tutorial is written on an A100, is wrong on the exact hardware this lab
tells students to use.

fp16 is the correct choice there, and it is not merely a flag swap: fp16 has a much
smaller exponent range, so training needs **gradient scaling** to avoid underflow.
Trainers enable a GradScaler automatically when told `fp16=True`, which is why the
precision decision must reach the training arguments rather than only the model load.
