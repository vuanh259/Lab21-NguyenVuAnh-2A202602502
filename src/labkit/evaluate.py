"""Four-group evaluation and the regression gate.

Deck §21: perplexity alone is not evidence. A fine-tune is only a win if it beats a
*well-prompted base model* on the target task **without** quietly losing general
capability. So every run is scored on four groups:

    1. target      — does it do the job you trained it for?
    2. regression  — did it forget everything else? (deck §6.3)
    3. format      — does it obey the output contract?
    4. latency     — what did the win cost at inference time?

and compared against three frozen baselines:

    (a) base + naive prompt
    (b) base + a genuinely optimized prompt   <- the one that matters
    (c) the fine-tune

The graded question is not "did perplexity drop". It is: **did you beat (b), and
would you have noticed if you hadn't.**

Everything here is a pure function over already-generated strings, so the whole
harness is testable on a laptop with no GPU.
