"""Structural checks — the class of defect the behaviour tests are blind to.

Three findings in this lab (F-18, F-20, F-21) were all the same shape: a *derived or
referenced* artifact drifting from its source with nothing to catch it.

  F-18  colab/*.ipynb drifted from the build_colab.py BOOTSTRAP that generates them
  F-20  the dependency pins existed in three hand-synced copies
  F-21  the README's first instruction named a notebook that has never existed

None of them are behaviour bugs, so 84 behaviour tests said nothing. They cost zero
runtime to check.
